# Requirements
- To run the game you'll need to have at least a JRE installed on your computer. AdoptOpenJDK 8 or 11 for example.
- Lobbies are created on an IP:Port-basis. So to play a game you'll have to make use of an available online socket, or perhaps use port-forwarding to allow communication on a port on your routers external IP-address. 
- To start and play a game, you'll need to be between 5 and 10 players, each with their own program running.
- It is very much recommended to play the game in an Discord chat, to get the full experience of the game. ( Remember to mute when killed ;) )
# Running the game
 - The game can be run either by double-clicking the SecretHitler.jar file, or by navigating to the project folder in a Command Prompt, and writing "java -jar .\SecretHitler.jar"
 - From here you will be met with a main menu, in which you can choose to create or join a game. You will then be met with name input and TCP-address prompts.
 - A valid name input is a name that is: not empty, not a name of a player that is already in the game, and not "ChatBot".

# Playing the game
 - Rules can be found on https://www.secrethitler.com/assets/Secret_Hitler_Rules.pdf.
 - Each round, a player will be met with prompts of various dialogues and actions, that are well explained.
 - IMPORTANT: Do not leave the game, after a game is started. This will cause the game to crash for all players, since the game is based on data of each player in the game at game start.

# Sharing rights
- The game is based upon the original board game Secret Hitler, created by Mike Boxleiter,
  Tommy Maranges, and Mac Schubert. Our version is merely a digital modified adaption of their invention, 
  and is therefore released under the same Creative Common License [BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/).
